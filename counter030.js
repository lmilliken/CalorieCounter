document.getElementById('calorie-form');

// Designate what this form should do when it is submitted by chaining on the `onsubmit` property and set it equal to a function named `calculate`. You will create the `calculate` function later. For example, in `document.getElementById('my-form').onsubmit = processForm;`, the `onsubmit` property is set to`processForm`.
