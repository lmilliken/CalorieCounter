/* 
When a browser loads a page, it creates a Document Object Model (DOM) representation of the page which includes all of the HTML elements in a tree structure.
In JavaScript, you can access the DOM by referencing the global `document` object.
To view the DOM, you can try to console log it, like `console.log(document)`.
