/*
By default the `onsubmit` event will pass the event object as a parameter to the event handler function.
You can name this parameter anything you want, people usually call it `e`, short for event
Update the `calculate()` function to accept `e` as parameter.

Here is an example of an empty function called `square` that takes a `number` as a parameter
function square(number) {
}
